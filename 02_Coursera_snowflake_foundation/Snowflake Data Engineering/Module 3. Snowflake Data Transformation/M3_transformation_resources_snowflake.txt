Additional resources on data transformations with Snowflake
We covered a lot in Module 3. Here are some resources I recommend to learn even more about data transformations with Snowflake:

Data transformations with SQL and Snowpark 

Query Data in Snowflake
https://docs.snowflake.com/en/guides-overview-queries
 – You don't need to read everything in this section, but it does a good job of laying out common ways of querying data in Snowflake.

In the video, Christopher uses Jupyter Notebooks, but you can also use Snowflake Notebooks.

Snowpark Developer Guide for Python | Snowflake Documentation
https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/snowpark/python/index
 – Everything under this section is great. The "Using DataFrames" section is especially helpful and relevant. Browse the Java or Scala sections if those are your preferred programming languages.

Streams

Minor clarification on streams: Querying a stream returns the minimal set of changes from the stream's current offset to the current version of the table. You can query the stream over and over in this way, without affecting the stream's offset (i.e., you'll continue to get the same results). A stream advances the offset only when its contents are consumed. "Consuming", in this context, means specifically using stream contents in a

 transaction.

 – The parent section "Streams" is excellent for more information on how Streams work "under the hood".
